# sql-exercises

My solutions to SQL exercises collated from the web!

### Directory Structure

There is one folder for each source of questions. Each folder contains two sub-foldersâ€”one for the problem statements and one for the solutions. Each folder also contains a markdown doc that functions as a table of contents. This specifies the original location and difficulty level for each problem.

### Table of Contents

- [DataLemur](datalemur/toc.md)
- [StrataScratch](stratascratch/toc.md)

**To do:**

- Format problem statements for StrataScratch problems.
- Add medium and easy difficulty problems from StrataScratch.
- Add solved problems from Leetcode.
