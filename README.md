My solutions to SQL exercises collated from the web!

### Directory Structure
There is one folder for each source of questions. Each folder contains two sub-foldersâ€”one for the problem statements and one for the solutions. Each folder also contains a markdown doc that functions as a table of contents. This specifies the original location and difficulty level for each problem.

### Table of Contents
- [DataLemur](datalemur/toc.md)


**To do:**
- Add markdown files containing the problem statement and schema for each problem.
- Add solved problems from Stratascratch and Leetcode.
