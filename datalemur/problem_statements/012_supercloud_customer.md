A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is defined as a company that purchases at least one product from each product category.

Write a query that effectively identifies the company ID of such Supercloud customers.

As of 5 Dec 2022, data in the customer_contracts and products tables were updated.

**`customer_contracts` Table:**
| Column Name | Type
| --- | ---
| customer_id | integer
| product_id | integer
| amount | integer

**`customer_contracts` Example Input:**
| customer_id | product_id | amount
| --- | --- | ---
| 1 | 1 | 1000
| 1 | 3 | 2000
| 1 | 5 | 1500
| 2 | 2 | 3000
| 2 | 6 | 2000

**`products` Table:**
| Column Name | Type
| --- | ---
| product_id | integer
| product_category | string
| product_name | string

**`products` Example Input:**
| product_id | product_category | product_name
| --- | --- | ---
| 1 | Analytics Azure | Databricks
| 2 | Analytics Azure | Stream Analytics
| 4 | Containers | Azure Kubernetes Service
| 5 | Containers | Azure Service Fabric
| 6 | Compute | Virtual Machines
| 7 | Compute | Azure Functions

**Example Output:**
| customer_id
| ---
| 1

**Explanation:**
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.
