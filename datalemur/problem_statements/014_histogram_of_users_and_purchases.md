Assume you're given a table on Walmart user transactions. Based on their most recent transaction date, write a query that retrieve the users along with the number of products they bought.

Output the user's most recent transaction date, user ID, and the number of products, sorted in chronological order by the transaction date.

**`user_transactions` Table:**
| Column Name | Type
| --- | ---
| product_id | integer
| user_id | integer
| spend | decimal
| transaction_date | timestamp

**`user_transactions` Example Input:**

| --- | --- | --- | ---
| 3673 | 123 | 68.90 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00
| 9623 | 123 | 274.10 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00
| 1467 | 115 | 19.90 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00
| 2513 | 159 | 25.00 | 07/08/2022 12:00:00
| 1452 | 159 | 74.50 | 07/10/2022 12:00:00

**Example Output:**
