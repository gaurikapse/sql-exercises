ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.

Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

**`fraud_score` Example Input:**
| policy_num | state | claim_cost | fraud_score
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| ABCD1001 | CA | 4113 | 0.613
| ABCD1002 | CA | 3946 | 0.156
| ABCD1003 | CA | 4335 | 0.014
| ABCD1004 | CA | 3967 | 0.142

**Expected Output:**
| policy_num | state | claim_cost | fraud_score
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| ABCD1016 | CA | 1639 | 0.964
| ABCD1027 | CA | 2663 | 0.988
| ABCD1069 | CA | 1426 | 0.948
| ABCD1079 | CA | 4224 | 0.963
