Find the number of times the words 'bull' and 'bear' occur in the contents. We're counting the number of times the words occur so words like 'bullish' should not be included in our count.
Output the word 'bull' and 'bear' along with the corresponding number of occurrences.

| --- | ---
| draft1.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy.
| draft2.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are awaiting a bear market.
| final.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are awaiting a bear market. As always predicting the future market is an uncertain game and all investors should follow their instincts and best practices.
